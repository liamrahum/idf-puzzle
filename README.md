2022 Sukkot puzzle from the Israeli Defence Forces, solved by 4 high-schoolers.
### Names: Liam Rahum, Amit Biton, Shaked Angi, Noam Cohen
### All solvers are also part of Magshimim.

## 1 - Gathering clues
* We started by obvsering the puzzle at https://bit.ly/3ElJg17 (The puzzle's page).
* We looked through the video, and saw parts of a link in some frames
* Liam created a python script for saving each frame in the video.
## 2 - Happy Sukkot
* We found the following image - ibb.co/3CkxfH1
* It was an encypted message, called caesar cipher (17 letter difference)
* We eventually got the link www.idf.il/h4ppy_5ukk0t


## Update - puzzle solved!
* There wasn't an update about it, but on the same week we've solved the puzzle.
* There was a problem on IDF's website, the "Happy Sukkot" file we downloaded wasn't the correct one (ours was 15kb)
* In the correct Happy Sukkot file there was an hidden file which we found immediately after downloading it.
* In the file there was base64 text, with the actual puzzle in it, I don't remember the question exactly but it had something to do with Greek Mythology.

Eventually, the puzzle was completely solved.
